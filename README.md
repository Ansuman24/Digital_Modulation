# Digital_Modulation


The word DM stands for digital modulation and is a generic name for modulation methods.
This modulation modifies a carrier wave using discrete signals. Both amplitude modulation and frequency modulation approaches are analog in Indifference.
Digital modulation reduces communication noise while also increasing the signal intrusion's power. However, due to the needed procedure, it is relatively uncommon for digital modulation methods to include temporal delay. A comfy SST (Secure Stream Technology) audio is meant to avoid this.
Digital Modulation (DM) provides increased data capacity, enhanced information security, and speedier system accessibility through high-quality transmission.
As a result, DM techniques are in high demand because to their ability to communicate greater volumes of data than AM (analog) approaches.
The modulation method in which discrete signals are used to modulate carrier waves and remove noise from the waves is known as digital modulation.
